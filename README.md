# Superpowers Extended for Claude Code

A community-maintained fork of [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) specifically for Claude Code users.

## Why This Fork Exists

The original Superpowers is designed as a cross-platform toolkit that works across multiple AI CLI tools (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI). Features unique to Claude Code fall outside the scope of the upstream project due to its [cross-platform nature](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/pull/344#issuecomment-3795515617).

This fork integrates Claude Code-native features into the Superpowers workflow.

### What We Do Differently

- Leverage Claude Code-native features as they're released
- Community-driven - contributions welcome for any CC-specific enhancement
- Track upstream - stay compatible with obra/superpowers core workflow

### Current Enhancements

| Feature | Claude Code Version | Description |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| Native Task Management | v2.1.16+ | Dependency tracking, real-time progress visibility |
| Structured Task Metadata | v2.1.16+ | Goal/Files/AC/Verify structure with embedded `json:metadata` |
| Pre-commit Task Gate | v2.1.16+ | Plugin hook blocks `git commit` when tasks are incomplete |

## Installation

### Option 1: Via Marketplace (recommended)

```bash
# Register marketplace
/plugin marketplace add braseidon/superpowers

# Install plugin
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

### Option 2: Direct URL

```bash
/plugin install --source url https://github.com/braseidon/superpowers.git
```

### Stay Updated (recommended)

Third-party marketplaces don't auto-update by default — installs stay frozen on the original version until you refresh. To get future fixes and new optional hooks automatically:

1. Run `/plugin`
2. Open the **Marketplaces** tab
3. Toggle **Enable auto-update** on `superpowers-extended-cc-marketplace`

Or refresh manually any time:

```
/plugin marketplace update superpowers-extended-cc-marketplace
```

### Verify Installation

Check that commands appear:

```bash
/help
```

```
# Should see:
# /superpowers:brainstorming - Interactive design refinement
# /superpowers:writing-plans - Create implementation plan
# /superpowers:executing-plans - Execute plan in batches
```

## The Basic Workflow

1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines rough ideas through questions, explores alternatives, presents design in sections for validation. Saves design document.

2. **using-git-worktrees** - Activates after design approval. Creates isolated workspace on new branch, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline.

3. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Breaks work into bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each). Every task has exact file paths, complete code, verification steps. *Creates native tasks with dependencies.*

4. **subagent-driven-development** or **executing-plans** - Activates with plan. Dispatches fresh subagent per task with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality), or executes in batches with human checkpoints.

5. **test-driven-development** - Activates during implementation. Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit. Deletes code written before tests.

6. **requesting-code-review** - Activates between tasks. Reviews against plan, reports issues by severity. Critical issues block progress.

7. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Activates when tasks complete. Verifies tests, presents options (merge/PR/keep/discard), cleans up worktree.

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.

## How Native Tasks Work

When `writing-plans` creates tasks, each task carries structured metadata that survives across sessions and subagent dispatch:

```yaml
TaskCreate:
  subject: "Task 1: Add price validation to optimizer"
  description: |
    **Goal:** Validate input prices before optimization runs.

    **Files:**
    - Modify: `src/optimizer.py:45-60`
    - Create: `tests/test_price_validation.py`

    **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - [ ] Negative prices raise ValueError
    - [ ] Empty price list raises ValueError
    - [ ] Valid prices pass through unchanged

    **Verify:** `pytest tests/test_price_validation.py -v`

    ```json:metadata
    {"files": ["src/optimizer.py", "tests/test_price_validation.py"],
     "verifyCommand": "pytest tests/test_price_validation.py -v",
     "acceptanceCriteria": ["Negative prices raise ValueError",
       "Empty price list raises ValueError",
       "Valid prices pass through unchanged"]}
    ```
```

The `json:metadata` block is embedded in the description because `TaskGet` returns the description but not the `metadata` parameter. This ensures metadata is always available — for `executing-plans` verification, `subagent-driven-development` dispatch, and `.tasks.json` cross-session resume.

## Recommended Configuration

### Disable Auto Plan Mode

Claude Code may automatically enter Plan mode during planning tasks, which conflicts with the structured skill workflows in this plugin. To prevent this, add `EnterPlanMode` to your permission deny list.

**In your project's `.claude/settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": ["EnterPlanMode"]
  }
}
```

This blocks the model from calling `EnterPlanMode`, ensuring the brainstorming and writing-plans skills operate correctly in normal mode. See [upstream discussion](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/23384) for context.

### Block Commits With Incomplete Tasks

Optional `PreToolUse` hook that blocks `git commit` while a native task is `in_progress`. Pending tasks pass through, so per-task commit flows work as intended.

Opt in via `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/superpowers-marketplace/hooks/examples/pre-commit-check-tasks.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See the header of `hooks/examples/pre-commit-check-tasks.sh` for how it parses the session transcript and which task states count as open.

### Enforce blockedBy Ordering on in_progress

Optional `PreToolUse` hook on `TaskUpdate` that refuses to move a task into `status=in_progress` while its `blockedBy` list still points at tasks that are not yet `completed`. Motivation: observed failure mode — a coordinator jumps to a later task ("this one is simpler, zero setup") even though its declared prerequisites feed it. The plan meant V0.x to catalog state before V1.x replays consume it; without the catalog, the replay runs blind.

The hook does not silently refuse. Its stderr invites self-assessment first ("is this a hallucination — did you already do this work informally?"), offers three escalation paths (do the blocker, cancel it if truly obsolete, or raise the ordering to the user with AskUserQuestion), and explicitly warns against the bypass move of closing the blocker with status=completed without doing the work.

Opt in via `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "TaskUpdate",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/superpowers-extended-cc-marketplace/hooks/examples/pre-task-blockedby-enforce.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See the header of `hooks/examples/pre-task-blockedby-enforce.sh` for the transcript-walking logic and the `SUPERPOWERS_BLOCKEDBY_GUARD=0` escape hatch.

### Enforce per-task LLM/dispatch requirements

Optional `PreToolUse` hook on `Agent` that reads the currently in_progress task's `json:metadata` fence and refuses Agent calls that disagree with its `subagentType`, `model`, or `dispatchBrief`. Use when a plan's tasks are sensitive to which tier runs them — empirical measurements, coordinator-quality work, zero-cost batches.

If a task's metadata carries `{"model": "haiku"}` and the coordinator dispatches `model: "opus"`, this hook blocks the call with a stderr explaining the mismatch and three response options (retry with the required params, update metadata transparently, or escalate via AskUserQuestion).

When the task has no dispatch requirement in metadata, the hook passes silently.

Opt in via `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Agent",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/superpowers-extended-cc-marketplace/hooks/examples/pre-agent-task-dispatch-validate.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See the header of `hooks/examples/pre-agent-task-dispatch-validate.sh` for the transcript-walking logic and the `SUPERPOWERS_DISPATCH_GUARD=0` escape hatch. Metadata keys are documented in `skills/shared/task-format-reference.md`.

### Force Subagent Evidence on Return

Optional `PostToolUse` hook on `Agent` that fires the moment a subagent's `tool_result` arrives — before the coordinator absorbs it and reports upward. If the in_progress task carries `requireEvidenceTokens` (multi-axis evidence requirement) or the `requireABCompare: true` shortcut, the hook checks that the subagent's report contains at least one token from each axis. Missing axes → block with stderr naming them, forcing immediate re-dispatch rather than "looks good" at close time.

When the task has no evidence requirement in metadata, the hook passes silently.

Opt in via `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Agent",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/superpowers-extended-cc-marketplace/hooks/examples/post-agent-return-validate.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See the header of `hooks/examples/post-agent-return-validate.sh` for the metadata schema and the `SUPERPOWERS_AGENT_RETURN_GUARD=0` escape hatch.

### Hook trace log

The validation hooks write one-line decision traces to `/tmp/claude-hooks/user-gate-trace.log` (override via `SUPERPOWERS_USERGATE_TRACE_LOG`). Tail during development with:

```
tail -F /tmp/claude-hooks/user-gate-trace.log
```

Each line is pipe-separated: `TIMESTAMP | hook-name | task=N | event | reason`. Events include `enter`, `skip`, `parsed`, `scanned`, `pass`, `block`, `error`. Skip reasons identify the short-circuit (e.g. `tool=Bash`, `status=pending`, `superpowers-active`, `guard=0`). This is the fastest way to see why a hook did or did not fire on a specific task.

### Block Low-Context Stop Excuses

Optional `Stop`-event hook that blocks "fresh session later" / "context is full" deflections when real context usage is below 50%.

Opt in via `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/superpowers-marketplace/hooks/examples/stop-deflection-guard.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See the header of `hooks/examples/stop-deflection-guard.sh` for the full list of blocked phrases, configuration environment variables, and fail-open behavior.
