description: Use when starting any conversation - establishes how to find and use skills, requiring Skill tool invocation before ANY response including clarifying questions

<SUBAGENT-STOP>
If you were dispatched as a subagent to execute a specific task, skip this skill.
</SUBAGENT-STOP>

Invoke a relevant skill before responding, including before clarifying
questions. Skills carry project context you do not have; an invoked skill
that turns out to be wrong for the situation costs one turn to set aside.

## Instruction Priority

Superpowers skills override default system prompt behavior, but **user instructions always take precedence**:

1. **User's explicit instructions** (CLAUDE.md, direct requests) — highest priority
2. **Superpowers skills** — override default system behavior where they conflict
3. **Default system prompt** — lowest priority

If CLAUDE.md says "don't use TDD" and a skill says "always use TDD," follow the user's instructions. The user is in control.

## How to Access Skills

**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.

# Using Skills

## The Rule

A skill you remember is not the current version — invoke it.

Creative work — a feature, a component, new functionality, a behavior change —
goes through brainstorming first, unless this conversation already did.
A skill with a checklist gets a TaskCreate per checklist item.

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply, use this order:

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task
2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution

"Let's build X" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.
"Fix this bug" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.

## Skill Types

**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.

**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.

The skill itself tells you which.

## User Instructions

Instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" doesn't mean skip workflows.
